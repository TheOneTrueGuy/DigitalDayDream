Digital daydreaming with CLIP Interrogator and Diffusers

My eventual intention is to add a genetic algorithm into this mix but the simple feedback loop itself was so fascinating I couldn't pass up sharing. Please let me know if there are any problems getting it to work, it took me the better part of a week to find all the components that would work together (thanks Amin and Pharmapsycho) 

(notice: this file may occasionaly be under edit. If it doesn't work please let me know and give it a 2nd chance later)
